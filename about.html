    <h2> WHO AM I?</h2>
    <p> </p>

    <h2>Gabriel Aeron A. Exconde</h2>

    <p>
        I am currently a second year college taking BSIT in Laguna State Polytechnic University.
    </p>


    <p>
        When I step away from the school, I believe in keeping things balanced.
        I’m a casual gamer so you’ll often find me playing online games like Mobile Legends
        or Call of Duty Mobile with my friends to relieve stress.
        I’m also a huge foodie, and nothing beats a sizzling plate of Sisig after a long week.
        And honestly? I value my rest. I love to sleep because I believe a well-rested mind
        is a productive one.
    </p>

    <h2> My Interests</h2>

    <p>
        I’m a huge mobile tech enthusiast. I eagerly anticipate the yearly smartphone releases
        to see how the industry evolves. I spend a lot of time watching deep-dive reviews to stay
        informed—my go-to source is Qkotman YT because I appreciate the honest, no-hype breakdown
        of specs and performance.
    </p>

    <h2> My Hobbies</h2>

    <p>
        I believe that a healthy mind requires a healthy body. To stay grounded and physically active,
        I make jogging and walking a regular part of my routine; it’s my favorite way to clear my head
        and stay disciplined. When it's time to unwind, I love to watch anime and movies
    </p>
